# Status Effect Bars

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that adds small configurable bars to the status effects HUD to show their remaining duration.

Requires [Cloth Config]. The config screen can be accessed using Mod Menu ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)).

Features:
- Cute little bars
- Customizable colors and position
- Bars can be hidden is some specific cases to reduce clutter (e.g. beacon effects and very long effects)

TODO:
- Icon
- Replace padding option with width
- Bars in inventory screen (disableable)

## Credits
- Potentially inspired by [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863)'s active effects HUD
- Config screen powered by [Cloth Config]
