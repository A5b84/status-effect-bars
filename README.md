# Status Effect Bars

A client-side [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) mod that adds small customizable bars to the status effects overlay and in the inventory to show the remaining duration of effects.

Features:
- Cute little bars
- Config screen to edit colors and bar positions
- Bars can be hidden automatically in some specific cases to reduce clutter (e.g. beacon effects and effects with very long durations)

Requires Cloth Config ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)). The config screen can be accessed using Mod Menu ([CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu) / [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu)).

## Credits
- Potentially inspired by [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/3863)'s active effects HUD
- Config screen powered by Cloth Config
